# mergesort

Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm for the efficient sorting of large lists.
It is a stable O(nlogn) algorithm that requires O(n) additional space (O(1) for the linked list implementation).
As implemented here i have included the typical top-down recursive version for both vector and linked list types
as well as a dynamic programming bottom up (iterative) implementation.

TO DO: re-write using STL style iterators
